want to track down these licenses and read them for yourself, use
the parts that I'd prefer:

(0) I wrote it and you didn't.

(1) Give credit where credit is due if you borrow the code for some
other purpose.

(2) If you have any bugfixes or suggestions, please notify me so
that I may incorporate them.

(3) If you try to make money off of cowsay, you suck.
